# News_Website
 
Itâ€™s a news website that uses HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript to display news data from the NewsAPI. The website is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a search button that allows you to easily find news related to your keyword of interest.

In this project, I have learned to fetch data through third party axios method and display the data on the website.
